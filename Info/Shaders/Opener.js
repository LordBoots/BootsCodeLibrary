// Welcome to the Phaser Code Library!


// This interactive library provides a collection of reusable code snippets and components for Phaser game development.
// My aim to to make it easier for rosebud users to grab libraries and code snippets other users and myself would like
// to make availaibe to other users. 
// I think this could be a powerful system for finding premade solutions to everyday problems and even some more complex
// one that are here just for the sake of sharing.

// Most scripts should be documented and ready to use in your Phaser projects althoug some are not finished enough to be
// documented yet. Some are not finished and will be clearly labeled so with a symbol.  

// Browse, copy, and integrate!
// Get started by exploring the categories in the library panel.

// Quick Guide:
// - Browse categories on the left panel
// - Click '+' to expand categories and subcategories
// - Click on any script to view its code
// - Use 'Copy' button to copy code to clipboard
// - 'Fold/Unfold All' buttons to collapse/expand code sections
// - 'Undo/Redo' buttons to manage your edits
// - Press 'L' key to toggle between vertical and horizontal layouts
// - Some script can be run by clicking the 'Load script' button in the code view - 
//   these sxripts are dictated by symbols next to them.

// Symbol Legend:
// - Controller üéÆ - ThreeJS executable script.
// - Joystick üïπÔ∏è - Phaser executable script.
// - Rainbow üåà - GLSL Shader executable.


// There is a section for tips on inetegration practices in the "How to" section of the code library. I would highly suggest if you're
// not code savy that you read though that section as it will give code you copy over the best chances of success.
// I will try to provide working demos of most of the libraries and components I post - there will be tips on how to manage this
// in the "How to" section
// There is a category for documentation at the bottom of the categories list (There is currently nothing in it).


// ===================================================================================================================
// Contact me if you have any scripts you would like to be reviewed for adding to the app. 
// If you can keep these scripts as modular as possible so that users can integrate them into their
// own projects - this would be the best solution for everyone.
// This application will eventually be available on my Rosebud related site "RoseBoots".
// Stay tuned for it's release - Updates will be be posted here.
