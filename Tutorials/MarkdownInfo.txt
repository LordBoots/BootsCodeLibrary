<--Markdown file formatting:-->
<-16->
The markdown file for tutorials must be formatted in a specific way to work. It's not particularly hard to follow 
BUT it must be followed without exception.

Typically you will denote sections based on what type of content you want to dispplay in that section. 
The section will then be automatically parsed and added to the tutotrial viewer based on the block settings. 
I'm constantly expanding the markdown legend list to make for better and better formats and greater customization.

Content and text blocks preserve the layout of the text within.

Current Legend: 
-- : content block, == : title, ## : image 

Below you'll find an image of the format of this tutoral source file:
